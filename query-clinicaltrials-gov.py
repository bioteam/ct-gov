Query clinicaltrials.gov:

*  Get total number of subjects for some sponsor, location, and study status.
*  Get number of studies for some sponsor, location, study type, and study status.

See the documentation:

*  https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/api/
*  https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/api/gui/ref/crosswalks

Example query as URL:

https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/api/query/field_values?expr=SEARCH%5BLocation%5D%28AREA%5BLocationFacility%5DNIH+Clinical+Center%29&field=OutcomeDenomCountValue&fmt=json

Equivalent to: SEARCH[Location](AREA[LocationFacility]NIH Clinical Center)

Query Field Values:

*  Name of the sponsor: LeadSponsorName (e.g. "NINDS")
*  Facility name: LocationFacility (e.g. "NIH Clinical Center")
*  Study type: StudyType (e.g. "Interventional", "Observational") 
*  Study status: OverallStatus:
    Completed: The study has concluded normally; participants are no longer receiving an intervention or being examined (that is, last participantâ€™s last visit has occurred)
    Recruiting: Participants are currently being recruited, whether or not any participants have yet been enrolled
    Active, not recruiting: Study is continuing, meaning participants are receiving an intervention or being examined, but new participants are not currently being recruited or enrolled
    Enrolling by invitation: Participants are being (or will be) selected from a predetermined population
    Not yet recruiting: Participants are not yet being recruited
    Suspended: Study halted prematurely but potentially will resume
    Terminated: Study halted prematurely and will not resume; participants are no longer being examined or receiving intervention
    Withdrawn: Study halted prematurely, prior to enrollment of first participant

Field:

*  Number of Participants Analyzed: EnrollmentCount
*  Number of Studies: StudyType
